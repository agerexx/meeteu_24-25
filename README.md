## Team Milan1 MEET-EU project 2024/2025
Hi everyone! I've created this repository so that you can start to familiarize with GitHub, since the final works have to be uploaded using GitHub. 
It could also be useful to share data and code with the paired team. 

Here you can find the notebook we are using to build an easy Random Forest Classifier with sklearn.
